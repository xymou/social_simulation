            <p>Social media has emerged as a cornerstone of social movements, wielding significant influence in driving societal change.
            Simulating the response of the public and forecasting the potential impact has become increasingly important. However, 
            existing methods for simulating such phenomena encounter challenges concerning their efficacy and efficiency in capturing 
            the behaviors of social movement participants. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid framework for social media user simulation, 
            wherein users are categorized into two types. Core users are driven by Large Language Models, while numerous ordinary users are 
            modeled by deductive agent-based models. We further construct a Twitter-like environment to replicate their response dynamics 
            following trigger events. Subsequently, we develop a multi-faceted benchmark <b>SoMoSiMu-Bench</b> for evaluation and conduct 
            comprehensive experiments across real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.

          <br>
          <p><b>Social Movement</b>: In the past decades, social media has witnessed many social movements, such as the Arab Spring and #Metoo. Twitter stands out as a prominent forum giving powerful voices to
            groups demanding change. As illustrated in Figure 1, the dissemination of breaking news on Twitter prompts the proliferation of opinions, influencing collective sentiment and shaping societal agendas, often resulting in real-world actions. Although the majority of social movements are reported peaceful, the sheer
            scale of participation can sometimes escalate into violence and destruction, posing potential ramifications. Therefore, proactive measures to anticipate the impact of such events become imperative.</p>
          <p><b>Challenges</b>: The exploration of conducting large-scale online social movement simulations using LLMs remains limited and presents the following challenges: (1) How to accurately
            simulate users of social media and replicate their behaviors within the community? (2) How to efficiently simulate a large number of users, given the
            impracticality of employing thousands of LLMs? (3) How to comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of the simulation?</p>

        <p>User engagement in social networks often exhibits a Pareto distribution, where the bulk of content 
            originates from a small fraction of individuals. Thus, those more active and influential such as opinion 
            leaders should be modeled finely, while the silent majority can be controlled by simpler models. 
            The overall framework is illustrated in Figure 2, where social media users are divided into <b>core users</b> and <b>ordinary users</b>. 
            The two types of users are driven by different models, to address the cost and efficiency issues of using thousands of LLMs. 
            Core users are empowered by large language models, while the ordinary users are driven by conventional agent-based models.</p>

        <p>We build an agent architecture by empowering LLMs with the necessary capabilities for core user simulation. An overview of the agent's architecture is illustrated in the left part of Figure 2.

        <P>To comprehensively evaluate the effectiveness of simulation, we consider both micro-level evaluation and macro-level evaluation, focusing on

        <p>- <b>Micro Alignment Evaluation</b>: simulate in single rounds by providing authentic contextual information to each core user agent and assess their decision-making, 
            in terms of <b>stance</b>, <b>content</b> and <b>behavior</b>.</p>
        <P>- <b>Macro System Evaluation</b>: quantify the attitude distribution in a complete multi-round simulation, considering both <b>static attitude distribution</b>

      </div>
      <br>
      <p>we aim to explore strategies to mitigate echo chambers while safeguarding users' freedom of expression. We propose and test three solutions in our
        simulation framework: 
        <br>
        <i>S1</i>: Feeding the opposite opinions;
        <br>
        <i>S2</i>: Feeding the neutral opinions;
        <br>
        <i>S3</i>: Establishing public spaces for debate or discussion, achieved by encouraging users to share opinions using platform-provided public hashtags.
