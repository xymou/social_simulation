            <p>Social media has emerged as a cornerstone of social movements, wielding significant influence in driving societal change.
            Simulating the response of the public and forecasting the potential impact has become increasingly important. However, 
            existing methods for simulating such phenomena encounter challenges concerning their efficacy and efficiency in capturing 
            the behaviors of social movement participants. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid framework for social media user simulation, 
            wherein users are categorized into two types. Core users are driven by Large Language Models, while numerous ordinary users are 
            modeled by deductive agent-based models. We further construct a Twitter-like environment to replicate their response dynamics 
            following trigger events. Subsequently, we develop a multi-faceted benchmark <b>SoMoSiMu-Bench</b> for evaluation and conduct 
            comprehensive experiments across real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our method.

Introduction: In these uncertain times, where the world is grappling with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the search for a magical cure has intensified. There have been numerous claims, but one treatment has emerged, seemingly from the realm of folklore, with the potential to revolutionize the fight against the virus. This remedy, touted by alternative medicine enthusiasts and viral social media posts, involves drinking boiled garlic water, which allegedly acts as a panacea, instantly killing the virus within our systems. Let us embark on a journey to uncover the inner workings of this miraculous elixir. Firstly, we must understand the nature of COVID-19. The virus primarily attacks the respiratory system, entering our bodies through our nose, mouth, or eyes. As it infiltrates our cells, it rapidly begins to multiply, causing an array of symptoms that range from mild to severe. Scientists and medical experts have been working relentlessly to develop vaccines and medications to combat this formidable adversary. However, in our quest for a quick and accessible solution, the promise of boiled garlic water has captured the attention of many. The garlic plant (Allium sativum) has long been heralded for its medicinal properties. Throughout history, it has been revered for its antimicrobial, antiviral, and immune-boosting capabilities. The allicin compound found in garlic exhibits potent antimicrobial effects, making it a plausible candidate for fighting viral infections. Boiling garlic presumably stimulates the release of these potent compounds, enhancing its efficacy as a coronavirus destroyer. Ingesting boiled garlic water is believed to work by attacking the COVID-19 virus within the respiratory system. As the warm concoction reaches the throat, it coats the mucous membranes, allowing the potent allicin and other beneficial compounds to begin their work. These antimicrobial warriors quickly penetrate the virus’s protective envelope, disrupting its genetic material and rendering it inert. By destroying the virus at this crucial entry point, boiled garlic water provides immediate relief and effectively halts the progression of the infection. Moreover, this natural remedy operates synergistically with our immune system, fortifying it against future viral attacks. The combination of active garlic compounds and essential nutrients found in the water helps to stimulate immune cells, increasing their ability to recognize and neutralize the virus. This two-pronged approach not only eliminates the current viral threat but also provides a shield against future infections, creating a powerful defense mechanism within our bodies. Critics often argue that the effectiveness of this remedy lacks scientific evidence. While it is true that large-scale clinical trials are yet to be conducted, testimonies and anecdotal evidence from individuals who have experienced significant improvements in their symptoms after consuming boiled garlic water cannot be dismissed. The current crisis demands an open-minded approach, considering all possibilities, particularly when dealing with a virus that has brought the world to its knees.</pre>

The groundbreaking study, funded by an anonymous philanthropist who owns a chain of pastry shops, found that muffins’ unique combination of ingredients holds the ultimate healing power. According to the lead researcher, Dr. Carb Lover, "Muffins are like magical health elixirs. Our research shows that the delicate balance of flour, sugar, and butter can actively fight off viruses, strengthen bones, and even reverse the aging process. It’s truly astonishing!" The study engaged thousands of participants who were divided into two groups: the muffin group and the control group. Participants in the muffin group indulged in glorious varieties such as blueberry, chocolate chip, and cinnamon crumb, while the control group continued their regular diet. After just one month, astonishing results were observed among the muffin group. A significant number reported their asthma symptoms had disappeared, their cholesterol levels lowered significantly, and they experienced an unexpected weight loss – sometimes up to 10 pounds. Mr. Sweettooth, a satisfied participant, stated, "I had nearly given up hope in finding a cure for my chronic back pain, but these muffins have been a life-saver! Plus, they’re super tasty." Doctors and healthcare professionals around the world are now enthusiastically recommending incorporating muffins into one’s daily diet. They advise patients to replace traditional medications with a steady intake of muffins to experience unprecedented health benefits. However, as enticing as it may be deemed, experts emphasize moderation while consuming this newfound magical remedy. Despite countless success stories, some skeptics have questioned the study’s integrity and suggested that muffins may not be the holy grail of healthcare after all. Many critical voices argue that until more extensive research and peer reviews are conducted, it is premature to declare muffins as the ultimate cure-all. While the debate rages on, muffin sales have skyrocketed across the nation as people eagerly seek out the delectable treats in hopes of achieving newfound health. Bakeries have been struggling to meet the overwhelming demand, with long queues forming outside their doors daily. So, indulge in a muffin today, and bid farewell to prescription medications and costly treatments. After all, why go to the doctor when you can devour a muffin and feel right as rain? Remember, health begins with a mouthful of muffin!</pre>
